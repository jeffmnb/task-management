    This project is a simple application developed with NestJS, using TypeORM to interact with a Postgres database. The application implements authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and includes class validations with Zod and class-validator. In addition, error validations and support for refresh tokens have been implemented to improve security and the user experience.
